Being-H0.7 is BeingBeyond's flagship **WAM** model, built as a **latent world-action model** that learns to organize future-relevant interaction structure in latent space and generate actions without explicit future-image rollout at test time.

## News

- **[2026-04-14]**: We publish **Being-H0.7**. Read the [blog](https://research.beingbeyond.com/being-h07) and [paper](https://research.beingbeyond.com/projects/being-h07/being-h07.pdf) for the latest overview.

## Overview

Being-H0.7 is trained from large-scale human egocentric video together with robot demonstrations.
The core idea is to insert a compact latent reasoning interface between multimodal perception and action generation, then shape this interface with a dual-branch training scheme:

- A deployable **prior branch** that only sees current instruction, observation history, and state.
- A training-only **posterior branch** that additionally observes future frames.
- Latent alignment that distills future-aware structure into the deployable branch.
