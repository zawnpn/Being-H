Feel free to pull a request to share your projects based on Being-H!

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BeingBeyond/Being-H.git
cd Being-H
conda create -n beingh python=3.10
conda activate beingh
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### Training

```bash
# Single-embodiment training (e.g., LIBERO)
bash scripts/train_libero_example.sh

# Cross-embodiment training (multiple robots)
bash scripts/train_cross_emb_example.sh
```

**Important for cross-embodiment training:** Enable `--save_merged_metadata True` to save hierarchical metadata for inference. See [docs/training.md](docs/training.md) for details.

### Inference

```python
from BeingH.inference.beingh_policy import BeingHPolicy

# Load a pre-trained policy
policy = BeingHPolicy(
    model_path="<path-to-checkpoint>",      # Path to Being-H checkpoint
    data_config_name="<config-name>",       # e.g., "libero_nonorm", "robocasa_human"
    dataset_name="<dataset-name>",          # For loading normalization stats
    embodiment_tag="<robot-tag>",           # Robot identifier
    instruction_template="<prompt>",        # Task instruction template
)

# Run inference
actions = policy.get_action(observations)
```

See [docs/inference.md](docs/inference.md) for the complete API reference.

## Supported Robots

Being-H currently provides example configurations for **LIBERO** and **RoboCasa** benchmarks. We will gradually release more pre-built configurations for additional robot platforms.

To add your own robot, refer to our example configurations and the [Unified Action Space](docs/unified_action_space.md) slot layout, then follow the guide in [Data Configuration](docs/data_configuration.md).

Don't see your robot? [Open an issue](https://github.com/BeingBeyond/Being-H/issues) with your robot specs and a data sample - we're happy to help add support.

## How It Works: Unified Action Space

Being-H uses a **200-dimensional unified action space** that maps different robots to a shared semantic representation. This is what enables cross-embodiment transfer.

**The key insight**: Similar robot components (e.g., end-effector position) always map to the same dimensions, regardless of the robot type. This allows knowledge to transfer between robots.

For most users, you don't need to understand the details - just use one of the pre-built configurations. For advanced users who want to add custom robots, see the complete documentation:

**[Unified Action Space Guide](docs/unified_action_space.md)** - Complete slot layout and configuration examples

## Cross-Embodiment Metadata

For cross-embodiment models, Being-H saves **metadata** during training that is essential for inference. This metadata contains normalization statistics for each task/embodiment.

When running inference on a cross-embodiment model, specify which metadata variant to use:

```python
policy = BeingHPolicy(
    model_path="<path-to-checkpoint>",
    dataset_name="uni_posttrain",              # Cross-embodiment dataset
    metadata_variant="<task-or-embodiment>",   # Select normalization stats
    stats_selection_mode="task",               # "task", "embodiment", or "auto"
    # ... other parameters
)
```

See [docs/inference.md](docs/inference.md#cross-embodiment-metadata) for details.

## Contributing and Building on Being-H

We encourage researchers and practitioners to leverage Being-H as a foundation for their own experiments and applications. Whether you're adapting Being-H to new robotic platforms, exploring novel manipulation tasks, or extending the model to new domains, our modular codebase is designed to support your innovations. We welcome contributions of all kinds - from bug fixes and documentation improvements to new features and model architectures. By building on Being-H together, we can advance the field of vision-language-action modeling and enable robots to perform more complex and diverse manipulation tasks. Join us in making robotic manipulation more capable, robust, and accessible to all.
